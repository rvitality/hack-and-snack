## Inspiration
Sometimes all people knead is love.  So we set out to create an a-maize-ing platform for foodies to find their soymates. The fig idea behind this was to create something that helps people meet their butter half and to find out if theyâ€™re a matcha made in heaven.

## What it does
Soy Mate is a platform that is essentially a dating app for foodies and food-centric individuals.
When matching with other people, instead of the typical information that other dating apps emphasize on (such as their occupation or where they went to school), we wanted to emphasize on information such as their top three favorite dishes or their favorite food genre to further push the concept that Soy Mate is a food-focused dating app. When two people are a match, they can strike a conversation and talk to each other using the chat module of our application.


## How we built it
We developed the application with love using the React library for the frontend and TailwindCSS for styling. On the other hand, we used the Flask framework for the backend to develop the API endpoints for our application. Additionally, we used Socket.io to handle the websockets for the chat module, and DeSo for the authentication.
